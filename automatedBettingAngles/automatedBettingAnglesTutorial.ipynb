    "Formulating betting angles (or \"strategies\" as some call them) is quite a common pasttime for some. These angles can range all the way from very simple to quite sophisticated, and could include things like:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Laying NBA teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back\r\n",
    "* Laying AFL team coming off a bye when matched against a team who played last week\r\n",
    "* Backing a greyhound in boxes 1 or 2 in short sprint style races\r\n",
    "* Backing a horse pre-race who typically runs at the front of the field and placing an order to lay the same horse if it shortens to some lower price in-play, locking in a profit\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Beyond the complexity of the actual concept what really seperates these angles is evidence. You might have heard TV personalities and betting ads suggest a certain strategy (resembling one of the above) are real-world predictive trends but they rarely are. They are rarely derived from the right historical data or are concluded with the necessary statistical rigour. Most simply formulated their angles off intuition or observing a trend across a small sample of data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There **are** many users on betting exchanges who profit off these angles. In fact, when most people talk about automated or sophisticated exchange betting they are often talking about automating these kind of betting angles, as opposed to betting ratings produced from a sophisticated bottom-up fundemental modelling. That's because profitable fundemental modelling (where your model which arrives at some estimation of fair value from first principles) is very hard.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The reason this approach is so much easier is that you assume the market odds are right **except** and go from there applying small top-down adjustments for factors that haven't historically been incorporated in the market opinion historically. The challenge lies in finding those factors and making sure you aren't tricking yourself in thinking you've found one that you can profit off in the future.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once again this another example of the uses of betfair historical stream data. To get cracking - as always - we need historical odds and the best place to get that is to self serve the historical stream files."

    "So back Little Vulpine whenever it races? We all know intuitively what's wrong with that betting angle - it's raced one time in our sample and happened to win at a bsp of 270 odd. Sample size and variance are dominating this simple measure of historical POT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead what we can do is treat the historical betting outcomes as a random variable and apply some statistical tests of signifance to them. A more detailed discussion of this particular test can be found [here](https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/testing_reliabiity_of_t-test_approximation_for_testing_betting_recrods.php) as can an excel calculator you can input your stats into. I'll simply translate the test to python to enable it's use when formulating our betting angles.\n",

    "The TLDR version of this test is that it based on your bet sample size, your profit, and the average odds across that sample of bets, the calculation produces a p value which estimates the probability your profit (or loss) happened by pure chance (where chance would be an expectation of breakeven betting simply at fair odds).\n"

    "\r\n",
    "This analysis is just a sketch. Heopfully it helps inspire you to think about what kinds of betting angles you could test for a sport or racing code you're interested in. It should give you a framework for thinking about this kind of automated betting, and how it differs from fundemental modelling. It should also give you a few tricks for coming up with your own angles and testing them with the rigour needed to have any realistic expectations of profit. Most of the betting angles you're sold are faulty or have long evaporated from the market by people long before you even knew the rules of the sport. You'll need to be creative and scientific to create your own profitable betting angles, but it's certainly worth it to try."
